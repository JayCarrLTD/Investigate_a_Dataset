# Udacity-Project

This project is an data analysis of a physicians offices patient information. The project seeks to understand if there is a relationship between certain factors and a patients likliehood of being a no-show patient. 

## Scenario
A physicians office is trying to establish if there is a coorelation between varios underlying circumstances that would lead to a decrease in patient no-shows. The idea behind this analysis would be to reduce the number of no-shows which would in turn generate increased revenue for the physicans office. 

## Data
The dataset was obtained through the online educational program Udacity. The dataset was obtained from <https://tinyurl.com/kaggle-no-shows>

## Question
What can be done to reduce the number of no-shows in patients?

## Understand
The data that we're going to examine is going to be essential in understanding the relationship of the patients and their liklihood of the patient cancelling their appointment. The main factors that we're going to examine are those that we will be able to explore indepth through careful analysis. For this project, we are going to focus mainly on two variables, text messaging and age. 

We are ultimatley going to ask three major question in attempting to solve our main question:

1. Are text message reminders an effectective in reducing no-show appointments?
2. What are the no-show rates for each age group?
3. Which Age Groups Are Most Responsive to Text Messages
